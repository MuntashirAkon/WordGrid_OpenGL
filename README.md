# WordGrid Game

This is a reimplementation of the [WordGrid game](https://github.com/MuntashirAkon/WordGrid) written using OpenGL for native platforms.

## Building

It requires OpenGL with GLUT. For non-Windows platforms, it also requires SDL2 library.

### Windows

Building on Windows requires the GLUT library to be included during the building process. Since I do not have a Windows operating system, I cannot test it myself. But the project should build fine if I did everything correctly.

### Unix-like operating systems

To produce a binary file, run

```sh
make all
```

If is is successful, the app `wordgrid` should be available in the root directory.
